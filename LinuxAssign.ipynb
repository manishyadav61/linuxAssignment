        "1. What is Linux?\n",
        "  - Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system widely used in servers, desktops, and embedded systems. It is based on a kernel that manages hardware resources like CPU, memory, and storage, providing essential services to applications. Being open-source, Linux allows anyone to freely use, modify, and distribute it, making it highly popular for both personal and enterprise solutions. Known for its security, stability, and multitasking capabilities, Linux supports multiple users simultaneously and can run on various hardware platforms.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What is the difference between Hard Link & Soft Link?\n",
        "  * A hard link is essentially a direct reference to the actual data of a file on the disk. Both the original file and the hard link share the same inode number, meaning they point to the same physical data. This makes a hard link indistinguishable from the original file, and even if the original file is deleted, the data remains accessible through the hard link. However, hard links can only be created within the same file system and generally cannot link to directories to avoid recursive loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * On the other hand, a soft link, also known as a symbolic link, works more like a shortcut that points to the pathname of the target file rather than directly to the data. It has a different inode number from the original file and can link across different file systems as well as to directories. If the original file is deleted, the soft link becomes broken and unusable because it only stores the path to the file, not the actual data. Soft links are easily identifiable as they show an arrow (->) pointing to the target file, whereas hard links appear as regular files.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Example\n",
        "  ```base\n",
        "  # Create an original file\n",
        "  echo \"Hello Linux\" > manish.txt\n",
        "  # Create a Hard Link\n",
        "  ln manish.txt hardlink_file\n",
        "  # Create a Soft Link\n",
        "  ln -s manish.txt softlink_file\n",
        "  # List details\n",
        "  ls -li\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "3. What is a Kernel in Linux?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* In Linux, the Kernel is like the brain and heart of the operating system. It’s the very first program that loads when you start your computer and acts as a bridge between your computer’s hardware and the applications you use.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Think of it this way – when you open a file, play music, or connect to Wi-Fi, your applications don’t talk directly to the hardware. Instead, they ask the Kernel for help. The Kernel then manages the CPU, memory, storage, and devices, making sure everything runs smoothly without conflicts.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* It also handles security, permissions, and multitasking, so multiple programs can run at the same time safely. Without the Kernel, Linux wouldn’t know how to communicate with your hardware, meaning nothing would actually work.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. How do you create a user account?\n",
        "   * Creating a user account in Linux is like adding a new member to your system, giving them their own username, password, and personal space to work in.\n",
        "   ```bash\n",
        "   sudo adduser manish\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "  * Linux will ask type a password for the new user.\n",
        "  * inux automatically sets up a home folder (like their personal locker) where all their files will be stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the ‘grep’ command used for in Linux?\n",
        "  * The grep command in Linux is used to search for specific text or patterns inside files.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * For Example:\n",
        "  ```bash\n",
        "  grep \"hello\" manish.txt\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Step1: Create user p1\n",
        "\n",
        " Step2: He should be part of 3 groups g1,g2,g3.\n",
        "\n",
        " Step3: whenever he creates a file automatically in the group section of file grp g1 shou\n",
        "  * Step 1: Create user `p1`\n",

        "  ```\n",
        "  * Step 3: Make g1 the default group for new files\n",
        "  ```bash\n",
        "  sudo usermod -g g1 p1\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "7. Step1: Create directory /tmp/bg as root user and create files inside it.\n",
        "\n",
        " Step2: “abhi” should be the owner of the directory. He should be able to create files and delete files inside the directory and also he should be able.\n",
        "  * Step 1: Create directory and files as root user\n",
        "  ```bash\n",
        "  sudo mkdir -p /tmp/bg\n",
        "  sudo touch /tmp/bg/file1 /tmp/bg/file2\n",
        "  ls -l /tmp/bg\n",

        "would you identify and terminate this process?\n",
        "  * To identify and terminate a process consuming excessive CPU resources in Linux, follow these steps:\n",
        "   1. Check running processes and CPU usage:\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "   3. Verify termination:\n",
